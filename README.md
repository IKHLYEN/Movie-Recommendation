movie recommendation system using python
In collaboration with AIAC IT CLUB, we've developed a comprehensive Movie Recommendation System. By leveraging the "MovieLens 100K Dataset" from Kaggle, our project aims to personalize movie suggestions.
Features:
    EDA: Delved deep into features such as movie title and user ratings to derive critical insights on trends and preferences.
    Recommendation Logic: Implemented a correlation-based collaborative filtering mechanism that takes into account both user behavior and specific movie attributes.
